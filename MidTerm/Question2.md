## Question 2 Write difference between abstract class and interface.

### 1. Concept:
- Interface: A is capable of [doing this (which B does)]
- Abstract class: A is a B

### 2. Impletation:
- A class can inherit only one Abstract Class.
- A class can implement more than one interfaces.

- The interface does not contain any concrete methods. All the methods of an interface are abstract methods.
- Abstract classes should have at least one abstract method. It can have multiple concrete methods.

### 3. Speed:
- Interface: slow
- Abstract Class: fast
