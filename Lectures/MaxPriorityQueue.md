# Max Priority Queue
In a max priority queue, elements are inserted in the order in which they arrive the queue and the maximum value is always removed first from the queue. For example, assume that we insert in the order 8, 3, 2 & 5 and they are removed in the order 8, 5, 3, 2.

The following are the operations performed in a Max priority queue...

```isEmpty()``` - Check whether queue is Empty  
```insert()``` - Inserts a new value into the queue.  
```findMax()``` - Find maximum value in the queue.  
```remove()``` - Delete maximum value from the queue.  

## Max Priority Queue Representations

- Using an Unordered Array (Dynamic Array)
- Using an Unordered Array (Dynamic Array) with the index of the maximum value
- Using an Array (Dynamic Array) in Decreasing Order
- Using an Array (Dynamic Array) in Increasing Order
- Using Linked List in Increasing Order
- Using Unordered Linked List with reference to node with the maximum value
