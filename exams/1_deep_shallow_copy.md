| Cloned object & source object | are not disjoint completely | are completely independent of each other | 
| Speed | fast | slow |
| Will changes made in the cloned instance impact the reference variable of the source object? | Yes | No |
| Condition preferred:|  if class variables of the object are only primitive type as fields |  if the objectâ€™s class variables have references to other objects as fields. |
